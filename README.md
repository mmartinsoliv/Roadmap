# Roadmap

## Motivation


The idea of this repo is to follow a roadmap of studies on what I want to improve. Within this roadmap I defined some points that I want to improve: `Algorithms and data structure`, `design patterns`, `functional programming`. In general, it's the concepts of computing, but some items were also thought of in DX.

I'm only going to focus on one topic at a time, as it's a way I can learn better.

## Checklist

- [ ] Algorithms and data structure
- [ ] Design patterns
- [ ] Functional programming
- [ ] UI and UX fundamentals

PS: I created some issues for some themes, and ideas in the issues is to have specific points about the theme 
and created a kanban board, to have a visibility of what is in `To do`, `WIP` and `Done`
